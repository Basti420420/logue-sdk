# Mono/Poly inspired oscillator

Mono/Poly inspired oscillator. By changing mode, you can set 4 oscs' behavior  (Paraphonic, OSC Rotation, Unison) which is iconic part of Mono/Poly.
Unlike Mono/Poly, all oscillators are wavetables.

## Parameters
- Shape
Sets every oscs' wavetable positions

- Wave
Sets every oscs' wavetable types

- Mode
Decide how to sound 4 oscs
1. Poly - Paraphonic mode
2. Rotation - Play the four oscillators in sequence.
3. Unison - Play 4 oscs simultaneously

- o1 Semitone
- o2 Semitone
- o3 Semitone
- o4 Semitone 
Sets each oscs' pitch in semitone

- Detune
Changes osc2 and osc 4 pitch slightly
